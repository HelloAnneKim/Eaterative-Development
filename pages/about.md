I studied Computer Science and Molecular Biology at MIT, but now I am free!  In my free time I enjoy running, **baking** , bananas, adventure time, and dank memes.  

The origin of the name `Eaterative Development` combines the two goals of improving my baking as well as coding. The two are similar in that when I bake, I always revisit good recipes and make small variations in an attempt to improve it. Similarly, iterative development in software plans how to break down a project into small features, implements, tests, and evaluates before deploying.

I love baking and have always wanted to chronicle my fun in some way besides flooding the Facebook newsfeed of my friends and family. I've decided to take it to oven -source technology. Sure, taking photos might increase the build time of my baking, but I don't think I'll roux it. I'll just have to rise to the extra challenge.
(I saved you from one more pun. I was thinking about calling this blog eaterative develoafment. hah.)

Checkout my code and some of my big big dreams at the [Github Repo][1]! Weeeee
