[TL;DR Recipe][TLDR-Recipe]

Since I'm in Korea, I might as well try to spice things up with a little local flavor. 팥 (red bean) is a really common flavor in Korean desserts, so it seemed like a no-brainer to add it to challah :D

* @Bready solid outside, soft inside
* @Asian_ish including some special Korean flavor

* @throws PanicDance If Jewish desserts and Asian flavor were just not meant to be and my experimentation just went too far and made a confused frankenstein's monster 
* @return challah

Don't panic if the yeast doesn't look too peppy and frothy.  It'll eventually wake up!  

1. 1T `Yeast` + 1T `Sugar` + 2.5C `Warm Water`: let **froth** for ~5min
2. 0.33C `Sugar` + 2T `Sesame Oil` + 2T `Coconut Oil` + 2 `Eggs` + 1T `Salt`: **mix** at medium speed until combined

3. 8C `Flour`: **slowly add** to Wet Ingredients
4. **Knead** 6-8min

    Wow so cute!

5. Let dough **rise** for 1.5hr

    If your dough thinks he's big and all, you can rough him up (punch the dough down).  That way, it's easier to divide and handle.

6. **Divide** dough in half
7. **Knead** each dough ball for 5min

    <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-03-red-bean-challah-1-0-images/7-roll.jpg" width="250">

8. **Roll** one dough ball into 2 sheets each about 8inx11in
9. **Spread** 0.333C of `red bean` on each dough sheet
10. **Roll** each dough sheet into a spiral
11. **Cut** each dough spiral length-wise

    <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-03-red-bean-challah-1-0-images/8-bean.jpg" width="250">

12. **Braid** a 4-string braid

    <img src="{{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-03-red-bean-challah-1-0-images/8-both.jpg" width="250">

13. Carefully place dough on a greased pan, **cover** with plastic wrap, and let **rise** for 1hr
14. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the second dough ball
15. 1 `Egg`: mix egg and **brush** challah
16. **Bake** in 375F (190C) oven for 40min

17. **Cool** for 10min; **Sample**

Code Review
===
* `Bready`: The bread had an amazing texture of hard on the outside while still staying moist on the inside [
![checkmark]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/check.jpg)]
* `Asian_ish`: It was still challah, but just had something delightfully interesting on the inside!  Surprise! [

TODO
===
* Make something cheaper: Sesame oil and coconut oil are pretty expensive, so I might try some kind of soy oil next time
* Make it more moist: maybe add less flour or try the [sponge method][sponge]
* Better filling: pick a less chunky red bean filling or pre-mash in the future iterations
