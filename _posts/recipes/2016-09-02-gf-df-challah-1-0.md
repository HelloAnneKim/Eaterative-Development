I was really missing pika (my co-op) at MIT.  Every night, we share a delightful homemade dinner by one of the rotations of big and little cooks.  Because the meal is made to be shared, it has to cater to everyone's dietary restrictions: omnivore, pescatarian, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low fodmap etc.  In the pika spirit, I embarked to make a gluten-free, dairy-free challah.  I would have gone the whole 9 and done vegan, but I really can't imagine doing challah without an egg wash.

1. 2T `Yeast` + 2t `Sugar` + 1.5C `Warm Water`: let **froth** for ~5min
![wet]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/3wet.jpg)

2. 2T `Sugar` + 1.5t `Salt` + 0.5C `Coconut Oil` + 6 `Eggs`: **mix** at medium speed until combined

3. Combine *Yeast Mixture*+*Other Wet Ingredients*
![gf-flour]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/1gf_flour.jpg)
I trusted you, internet...
![mix]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/4mix.jpg)
added flavor

4. /+6C *Gluten-Free Flour Mix* (4C `Rice Flour`+ 1.33C `Potato Flour` + 0.66C `Almond Flour`): **slowly** add to *All the Wet Ingredients*
![squirt]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/5squirt.jpg)
The batter was way too wet, so I had to think quickly.  The only thing that made sense to me was to control the slop by putting it into baggies

5. Attempt to **knead** for about 8min == **FAIL**
![pat]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/6pat.jpg)

6. **Squirt** into muffin tins, while sandwiching a squirt of `팥` (maybe 2C total?)
![proof]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/7proof.jpg)

7. **Proof** for 45min; **pray** for mercy
![proof]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/8eggwash.jpg)

8. /+1 `Egg`: **eggwash**
![bake]({{ site.urlimg }}2016-09-02-gf-df-challah-1-0-images/9bake.jpg)

9. **Bake** for 40min at 375F(135Celsius)

I hope I never have to taste this ever again

10. **Cool** for 10min; **Sample**; **Dump**

Code Review
===
* `Pikan-ish`: I didn't cave into adding any gluten or dairy. [

]
<!-- ![checkmark]({{ site.url }}/assets/check.jpg) -->
* `Still bready`: It was super dense and not very tastey at all. [ X ]
* `Asian-sh`: I added some 팥 (Korean red bean), so I guess it had that going for it [
![checkmark]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/check.jpg)
]

TODO
===
* Change gluten-free flour to a more professional mix
* Add less water next time, so it's more manageable as a braid-able dough
* Reduce eggs from 6 to 4 eggs
