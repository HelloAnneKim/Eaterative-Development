[TL;DR Recipe][TLDR-Recipe]

This time, no fancy stuff.  I just want to make challah that's tasty

Don't panic if the yeast doesn't look too peppy and frothy.  It'll eventually wake up!  

1. 1T `Yeast` + 1T `Sugar` + 2.5C `Warm Water`: let **froth** for ~5min
2. 0.33C `Sugar` + 2T `Sesame Oil` + 2T `Coconut Oil` + 2 `Eggs` + 1T `Salt`: **mix** at medium speed until combined

3. 8C `Flour`: **slowly add** to Wet Ingredients
4. **Knead** 6-8min

    Wow so cute!

5. Let dough **rise** for 1.5hr

    If your dough thinks he's big and all, you can rough him up (punch the dough down).  That way, it's easier to divide and handle.

6. **Divide** dough in half
7. **Knead** each dough ball for 5min

8. **Braid** one of the dough balls

9. Carefully place dough on a greased pan, **cover** with plastic wrap, and let **rise** for 1hr
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the second dough ball
11. 1 `Egg`: **mix** egg and **brush** challah
12. **Bake** in 375F (190C) oven for 40min

13. **Cool** for 10min; **Sample**

Code Review
===
* `Edible`: It was definitely better than just edible. [
![checkmark]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/check.jpg)]
* `Bready`: It was like real bread because I used real flour! [
![checkmark]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/check.jpg)]


TODO
===
* Make something cheaper: Sesame oil and coconut oil are pretty expensive, so I might try some kind of soy oil next time
* Make it more moist: maybe add less flour or try the [sponge method][sponge]
